#Enabling ActiveX Features in Excel Readme

If you encounter an error stating that Microsoft has disabled ActiveX features in Excel due to security issues, it means that your Excel settings are configured to restrict the use of ActiveX controls. To enable ActiveX features and resolve the issue, please follow the steps outlined below:

1.Open Excel Options: Launch Microsoft Excel and go to the "File" menu (or Excel menu on a Mac) in the top-left corner of the Excel window. Click on "Options" (or "Preferences" on a Mac) at the bottom of the menu. This will open the Excel Options dialog box.

2.Navigate to Trust Center: In the Excel Options dialog box, select the "Trust Center" (or "Security" on a Mac) tab from the left-hand menu.

3.Access Trust Center Settings: Within the Trust Center tab, click on the "Trust Center Settings" button. This will open the Trust Center dialog box.

4.Enable ActiveX Controls: In the Trust Center dialog box, select the "ActiveX Settings" (or "Legacy Controls" on a Mac) option from the left-hand menu.

5.Adjust ActiveX Control Settings: In the ActiveX Settings section, you will see various options for configuring ActiveX controls. To enable ActiveX features, select the checkbox for "Enable all controls without restrictions and without prompting" (or a similar option).

6.Add Trusted Locations (Optional): If your micro-enabled Excel file is located in a specific folder, you can add that folder as a trusted location to further enhance security. To do this, select the "Trusted Locations" option from the left-hand menu in the Trust Center dialog box and click on the "Add new location" button. Browse and select the folder where your Excel file is stored.

7.Save Changes: Once you have made the necessary changes to enable ActiveX controls, click the "OK" button to save the settings in both the Trust Center dialog box and the Excel Options dialog box.

8.Restart Excel: Close Excel completely and relaunch it to ensure that the changes take effect.
